DevOps is a combination of development team and operational team where they work together with communication and collaboration.   
to faster the software development process . with the help of Automating each and ever task from build to deployment phase . 
continues integration and continues delivery  to make business faster .

**Continues integration :** 

it a automated process in DevOps . It generates software products quickly and efficiently  

Developers develop the code continuously several times in a day them use to store a code a place called repository GITHUB they pull and push code several times in a day . 
how ever they push new changes that code would be automatically pull to (build phase )or build server . 
This would be build , test and evaluated the code and it would generate the software or we call it (artifact) . 
These artifact or a software  will be stored in software repository  . 
Based on the programing language these artifact will be package in specific format in JAVA (jar/war) , WINDOWS (DELL/EXE/MSI) and   (ZIP/TAR) . 
It from repository that would be send to further testing . after deploy a software on the server . software tester would conduct further testing once they approve . 
that would be send to a production server.
